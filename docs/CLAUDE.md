# CLAUDE.md - AI Context for Equity Financial Optimizer

## Project Overview
Equity compensation optimizer for ISO/NSO/RSU tax planning. Uses component-based architecture
where individual calculators extract event components, and annual tax calculator aggregates them
for actual tax calculations using progressive brackets (not flat rates).

## Architecture Principles
- Calculators are pure functions returning components, not final tax amounts
- Tax calculations happen at annual level after aggregating all events
- All inputs from JSON, all outputs to CSV (no CSV as intermediate format)
- Progressive tax brackets throughout - no flat rate approximations
- Timing matters: 364 vs 366 days = STCG vs LTCG
- Direct JSON-to-object loading via loaders, no complex intermediate representations

## Key Components
- calculators/: Specialized calculators (ISO exercise, share sale, donation, annual tax)
- engine/: Portfolio manager for scenario execution
- projections/: Multi-year projection engine with cash flow tracking
- loaders/: Direct JSON-to-ShareLot loading (no CSV parsing for inputs)
- scenarios/: JSON scenario definitions with optional tax_elections
- output/: CSV outputs for analysis (data-source specific: demo/ vs user/)

## Working Guidelines

### Session Management
**Start with goals, not solutions** - Ask "What are you trying to achieve?" and distinguish "building forward" vs "cleaning up"
**Present trade-offs** - Frame decisions as "Option A vs B" with clear pros/cons, not single recommendations
**Use pause points** - Before major changes, stop and confirm approach. Break large tasks into atomic steps
**Define success upfront** - Establish clear criteria before starting work

### Code Changes
**Edit atomically** - Make isolated, in-place edits. Read files before editing. Use `mv` to move files
**Respect boundaries** - Each file has a specific purpose. Don't mix concerns across files
**Test before and after** - Run tests before changes and verify they pass after
**Understand before removing** - Investigate why code exists before deleting it

### Documentation & State
**Document as you go** - Update docs inline with changes, not later. No time estimates in plans or dates in changelogs.
**Track state here** - Don't maintain separate todo lists. After commits, ask "what are the next steps?"

### Design Approach
**Keep it simple** - Aim for E2E validation over complex designs. Ask about abstraction preferences
**Use discovery questions** - Ask about constraints and risk tolerance rather than assuming

## Technical Standards
- Python 3 with type hints throughout
- Decimal for monetary precision
- ISO 8601 dates
- Comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Error messages user-friendly and actionable
- No external dependencies beyond numpy/pandas

## Data Flow
1. User profile (JSON) → loaders → ShareLot objects
2. Scenario (JSON) → planned actions + tax elections
3. Projection engine → processes actions → generates components
4. Annual tax calculator → aggregates components → calculates actual taxes
5. Results → CSV outputs for analysis

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for each calculator with known values
- Integration tests with realistic scenarios
- All monetary assertions use exact values, not approximations
- Test both federal and California calculations
- Edge cases: negative values, missing data, boundary conditions

## Current Status & Backlog

### Project Status
Production-ready core with comprehensive test coverage. Main calculators operational,
handling complex scenarios including tender offers, ISO exercises, charitable donations
with basis elections, and multi-year projections. Ready for enhancement with additional
state tax systems, ESPP support, and advanced optimization features.

### Project History
See CHANGELOG.md for complete feature history and implementation details.

### Implementation State
- Component-based tax calculation system fully operational
- Progressive brackets for federal/state income tax and LTCG
- AMT calculation with credit tracking across years
- Charitable deduction AGI limits (30% stock, 60% cash federal, 50% cash CA)
- Basis election for charitable donations (per-year configuration)
- Natural vesting through state transitions (no event detection needed)
- Comprehensive test suite with all tests passing
- Security model: demo vs user data separation with automatic fallback

### Known Issues
- Carryforwards not tracked separately by donation type (cash vs stock)
- Option expiration handling needs natural state transition implementation
- Ordering rules for charitable deductions could be more explicit
- Cash flow projections incomplete - only includes primary W2 income, missing spouse income, investment income, living expenses, tax withholdings, and AMT credit usage

### Inline TODOs in Code
- Basis election 50% limit hardcoded, should pull from tax_constants.py (annual_tax_calculator.py)
- Option expiration tracking not implemented in projection calculator
- Lot ID parsing in pledge obligations assumes specific underscore convention
- Tax limit percentages in CSV generation should differentiate federal vs state
- Forward reference in ProjectionResult needs documentation
- Price projections loading from external source not implemented (natural_evolution_generator.py)
- Redundant profile loading check needed in natural evolution generator

### Immediate Priorities
**Comprehensive Cash Flow Accuracy** - Update ProjectionCalculator to include:
   - All income sources from user profile (spouse W2, interest, dividends)
   - Living expenses from monthly_cash_flow section
   - Tax withholdings vs gross tax liability calculation (estimated_taxes section)
   - AMT credit carryforward usage from tax_situation
   - Investment growth modeling for taxable_investments balance
   - Accurate initial cash position from liquid_assets
   This will update both CSV outputs and text summaries with realistic cash projections
Partner with the user on a few detailed scenarios under consideration to stress test the model end to end and provide feedback on the accuracy and usability of the tool.
