    "This portfolio compares seven realistic equity compensation strategies:",

    "2. Exercise All Vested - exercise currently vested options immediately",
    "3. Tender and Donate - balanced liquidity and charity approach",
    "4. Exercise Aggressive - exercise ISOs as they vest to start LTCG clock ASAP",
    "5. AMT Basic - manage AMT by exercising ~$100K bargain element per year",
    "6. Charitable Frontload - exercise and donate early to maximize company match window",
    "7. Diversify - exercise and sell shares to diversify portfolio ASAP",
    "Focus is on avoiding option expirations while optimizing for different financial goals."
