    "This portfolio compares five core tax strategies:",
    "1. Natural Evolution - baseline do-nothing scenario",
    "2. Exercise All Vested - immediate exercise to start LTCG clock",
    "3. Tender and Donate - balanced liquidity and charity approach",
    "4. Personalized Comprehensive - conservative exercise amounts, early sales for house fund",
    "5. Personalized Strategy - optimized exercise timing, better option expiration management",
    "Both personalized strategies focus on AMT credit consumption, 3-year donation windows, and house funding with no opportunity loss."
