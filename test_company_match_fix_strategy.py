Strategy for fixing the company match calculation issue.

The problem: Company match is calculated AFTER pledge discharge to only match
eligible donations, but the DonationComponents are created BEFORE this calculation
with company_match_amount = 0.0.

Solution: Update the DonationComponents after calculating the actual match.
