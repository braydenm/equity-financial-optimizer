"""
Test to verify AMT credit generation and consumption logic.

This test verifies that AMT credits are EITHER generated OR consumed in a given year,
but NEVER both in the same year.

The rule is:
- If AMT > Regular Tax: Pay AMT, generate credits, DON'T use existing credits
- If Regular Tax > AMT: Pay Regular Tax, use existing credits, DON'T generate new credits
