Test to verify federal vs state charitable deduction persistence functionality.

This test verifies that AnnualTaxCalculator correctly calculates and persists
both federal and California charitable deduction results with their different
AGI limits. Both results are now properly stored in AnnualTaxResult, enabling
accurate tracking of state-specific carryforwards in multi-year projections.

VERIFIED: Both federal and California charitable deduction results are accessible.
